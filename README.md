Hey everyone, I hope all is well with you. You all know that I make websites and apps. I also try to help my clients with this. You know that GigToDo is a freelance service. Market was one of the best places to buy things. They left their business, though, because they couldn't get help and there were bugs. 
I did have the most recent version of the GigToDo Mobile apps and script pack, though. Thanks to my Fiverr client.
It comes with an API and needs GigToDo marketplace script 1.5.4 to run.
 To make it work, I made a lot of changes and tweaks. This is now ready to be used again. If you want to make a marketplace website with the script that doesn't have any bugs and the video call + notification plugin, click here.  All of that stuff is in my http://donegrab.com 
 script store.
 On the other hand, you can reach me on Telegram at @TechdoorBD.
Keep an eye on Tech Door BD for more fun and useful videos. It's just a summary. Leave a message to get a tutorial on how to build an app.
